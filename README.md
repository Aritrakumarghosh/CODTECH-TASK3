PROJECT: EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS(EDA) ON TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION DATASET

OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT: PREDICTIVE MODELING WITH CLASSIFICATION By Detection of fraudelent credit card transactions.
The transaction data was meticulously preprocessed and normalized to ensure consistency and reliability.
Techniques to handle class imbalance, such as oversampling or undersampling, were applied effectively.
Data Split:

The dataset was split into training and testing sets using train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection.
Models Selected and Trained:

I utilized powerful classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression and Random Forests from sklearn.ensemble.
A Pipeline from sklearn.pipeline was constructed to streamline the preprocessing and modeling steps.
The model was trained on the training set to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine.
Performance Optimized:

Key metrics including precision, recall, and F1-score were optimized to ensure robust performance.
Classification reports from sklearn.metrics were generated to evaluate model performance on the test set.
Results
The model achieved outstanding [insert your metrics results here], demonstrating its effectiveness in fraud detection.
It successfully balanced high precision in identifying fraudulent transactions with minimal false positives.
Learning Outcomes
This project significantly enhanced my expertise in data preprocessing, model selection, and fraud detection techniques.
It underscored the critical role of machine learning in safeguarding financial transactions against fraud.
